# Project Proposal

## Project Title:
 The Relationship between Massive Transfer Spending in Football and Improved Team Performance

## Category:
Data Analysis & Visualization ; Sports Analytics Tool: Calculate player/team statistics and performance metrics

## Problem statement or motivation:
Over the past two decades, as football has skyrocketed in popularity, it has evolved into a highly commercialized sport, attracting ever-growing investment through international wealth and sponsorships. 
This surge in financial resources has led clubs to spend exorbitant sums in the transfer market to acquire their sought-after players. 
This, then, raises an important question: has the rise of massive transfer spending in football actually translated into improved team performance?

## Planned approach and technologies:
 I will use OOP to structure the components of the project. E.g., creating classes like Season and Player to store financial and performance data. 
 Functions can be used for data compilation, cleaning, and statistical analysis. E.g., t-test between high-spending teams and low-spending teams. 
 Datasets can be imported, loaded, read and managed using JSON and CSV. 
 Python modules will be utilized to import specific built-in functions relevant to data handling and statistical operations. 
 Data libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib will be crucial to analyze and visualize data effectively without having to build complex functionalities from scratch. 
 Finally, statistical methods such as regression, difference-in-differences, correlation analysis… will evaluate the impact of massive spending on team performance.

 ## Expected challenges and how you’ll address them:
 This is how I will address my struggles. For python I will use the lectures, I will practice coding on my own to acquire experience, I will regularly test my code and use the debugging system. 
 I will use forums  e.g., stack overflow but also the official python documentation. I can contact the assistants. I can also use AI cautiously as a last resort. 
 In regards to the statistical methods, I will be consulting the lectures of the statistical courses that I was enrolled in during previous years.

 ## Success criteria (how will you know it’s working?):
  I will verify the sources, I want to gather correct and factual data. Football is a very well reported sport, finding data should be easy. 
  I can corroborate my findings with other reports on the issue as it’s surely already been heavily commented on given the relevance of the issue. 
  I will regularly test my code and debug it in order to eliminate all errors. Furthermore, I can compute additional statistics to help verify that my output is coherent. 
  Charts and graphs will help visualize these empirical results clearly.. I will also apply the code to other datasets to confirm it works generally, not just an outlier in this case.

  ## Stretch goals:
   If time permits, I can add my own algorithm where for instance, you can input the name of a given player and see how he performs relative to his market value.
