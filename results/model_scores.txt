MODEL PERFORMANCE (R² on Test Set)
===================================
===================================

Linear Regression:        0.1900
Random Forest Regressor:  0.1725
Gradient Boosting:        0.0807



Among the three ML models the Linear Regression model is the most accurate. This model explains 19% of the variation in the next season goals and assits i.e., after_G+A.

Falling closely behind, we find the Random Forest Regressor with an R² of approximately 17%.
This means that this model explains about 17% of the variations in the next season goals and assits.

Gradient Boosting comes in last place explaining only roughly 8% of the variations in the next season goals and assits.
