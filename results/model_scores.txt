MODEL PERFORMANCE (R² on Test Set)
===================================

Linear Regression:        0.1900
Random Forest Regressor:  0.1725
Gradient Boosting:        0.0807


Among the three ML models, the Linear Regression model is the most accurate. 
This model explains about 19% of the variation in next-season goals and assists 
(i.e., after_G+A).

Falling closely behind, we find the Random Forest Regressor with an R² of roughly 
17%. This means that the model explains around 17% of the variation in next-season 
performance.

Gradient Boosting comes in last place, explaining only about 8% of the variation 
in next-season goals and assists.

Linear Regression achieves the highest R² because the relationships in this 
dataset are mostly linear (e.g., a player who scored 10 goals with 5 assists is 
expected to perform better the next season than a player who only scored 5 goals 
and assisted 2). These relationships are also driven by a few strong features 
such as before-season G+A, xG, and xAG which ultimately are the most 
reliable indicators of future performance.

Despite performing slightly worse, Random Forest still captures certain 
non-linear relationships between variables such as age, transfer fee, and 
position. However, the small sample size limits its ability to generalize.

Gradient Boosting underperforms because it usually requires a much larger 
dataset and a more balanced target distribution to be effective. With our sample 
of fewer than 300 players, its boosting process becomes unstable. Several factors 
also contribute to this underperformance, such as omitted variables that strongly 
influence future player output (e.g., injuries, playing time, tactical role). 
These missing factors introduce bias. Additionally, attacking performance is 
very uneven in football: way more players score fewer than 5 G+A compared to those 
who achieve 20+ G+A. This skewed distribution makes it harder for 
the model to learn patterns for high-performing players.

Overall, these results reflect the reality of football statistics. Predicting 
future performance is extremely complex and often unpredictable. Many variables 
can influence a player’s next season, anything from injuries to tactical changes 
to personal factors. This unpredictability partly explains why betting companies 
are so profitable.

Nonetheless, the models still manage to capture meaningful patterns. They 
successfully use major factors such as transfer fee, age, position, and 
before-season performance to predict future performance.
